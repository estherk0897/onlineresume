        <style> p {text-align: left;} </style>
        <p "> As someone who is beginning to learn HTML, I have found 
            a lot of joy and interest for web development and excited to 
            use this later on in the future. I also have knowledge in Java 
            and have taken classes to deepen the knowledge for coding. Not only
            that, I have experience in Adobe InDesign from my classes and have 
            learned how to make graphics that are both pleasing to the eyes
            and can design what the client wants.
